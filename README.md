# GuessWho
## Created at She Codes for the Facebook hackathon, Israel. 

This android application is a multiple choice game to learn the names of your fellow colleagues before going to a Facebook event. You have three tries to get the name correct (with the three choices), if you still fail to answer correctly, the correct answer will pop up. The game, after logging into your Facebook account, can be played multiple times.
